These challenges were completed on an Apple \]\[ GS using Applesoft BASIC.

This required connecting the Apple to a modern computer over serial to receive the input data and upload the final source code. Communications ran at 19200 baud. More setup details will be added in the future.

Each part takes about a minute and a half to execute.

Here's a picture of the results of part2.bas on the Apple:
