My Advent of Code answers!

### 2022

So far, I have completed every day on my Apple \]\[gs using Applesoft BASIC. I'm going to continue with this until (if) the challenges become too complex for the Apple.

Otherwise, I'll be trying out Forth and Scheme, or will fall back to Clojure if necessary.

**2021:** Nearly all challenges were done in Clojure. I used C++ for a couple of the more challenging ones, and tried Maxima on a part too.

**2020:** Incomplete, just tried a day in Clojure.
