My Advent of Code answers!

**2022:**

Scheme (either MIT-Scheme or Gambit) will most likely be my first choice. Forth is a runner-up, but probably too much to stick with.

Day 1 will be attempted on an Apple ][ GS, using Applesoft BASIC.

**2021:** Nearly all challenges were done in Clojure. I used C++ for a couple of the more challenging ones, and tried Maxima on a part too.
**2020:** Incomplete, just tried a day in Clojure.
